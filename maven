Maven goals (building the application is called as goals-)
1. Compile
2. test
3. Package (Copying what you build & Pom file to .m2)
4. deploy
5. Clean

when you deploy a project in java we will see the files like jar/war/ear
these are zip files.

how to convert the spring petlinic into jar file this process is called Compile

when we run java files we need to have jar/war files

Compilation - converting the files in some format which is understandable by our OS.

incase of java or .net we need to have jdk install to make the jar file understandable.

After compilation we need to have convert it into package.

Build tools is to compile the java files

maven reley on one file pom.xml

maven can download or resolve dependencies

maven has huge global repository

so in pom.xml we have information about metadeta and dependency of the project.


inside your code you have pom.xml.
where there be pom.xml, there will be a folder called src

inside src 2 more folders
1. main - it has a folder say java which has java files basically tells which technology you are using 
2. test -if you have unit test cases

so once you compile the code mvn compile you can see that there is a new target folder gets created in your directory(where your pom file is.)

Inside target there are 2 new folders
1. class - it contains mymain.class file.
2. maven status

so if you have 100 files you cannot have so many class file, or that we do mvn package

mvn package

once you do mvn package you can see there is one jar file gets created in target folder which has the name of artifacts which you gives in pom.xml
artifactory is basically the name of the application which you want to create.
All the dependiency which will be downloaded will be saved on .m2 folder ->repository
