DOCKER SWARM

to work in the docker swarm (this is a 3 node cluster, 2 node and one manager)

1. docker swarm init (to initialize docker swarm)
   once you run this command, we get the outout as 
    docker swarm join -- token {someting}
2. docker node ls (to see how many nodes are listed in your manager)
3. now paste th docker swarm join command (from step 1 ), run this to the worker node you want to join
4. suppose you have lost the token command, then you can retrive it by the following command
  docker swarm join-token worker
5. to add master node - docker swarm join-token manager
6. How to remove a node from a cluster - docker swarm leave (this command should be run in the node)
7.  and to remove from the master use this below command - docker node rm -f <worker1>
8. both 6 and 7 command should be run to leave the node from the cluster.
9. docker node inspect workerr 1 (run this on master)
10. docker node promote worker1 worker2 (run this on master to promote the worker as master)
11. docker node demote worker1 worker2 (run this on mastrer to demote the master to worker)
12. docker node ls - to see the all the nodes in the cluster, this run only in the master.
13. watch docker container ls - this will give you the list of docker container every 2 seconds.
