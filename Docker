Docker

Install Docker

curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sh get-docker.sh


Add user to the docker
sudo usermod -aG docker <name>




Base image -- 1. Official image -- suppose a application is based out of Java and Spring, then we will choose the base 

image which already has Java
2. Published image  - in some case it is not possible, in that case we use Published image -- (Publisghed images
)
Then do your deployment
How can i run my application when container is starting



Base image -- From
Deployment  -- RUN
Start my app

-d is running the deamon- which is like a service which will run in the background.
ip addr- will give you IP address if your machine. ifconfig
docker images (to see what all are the images present in our docker)
inside every container it will have your private ip, processes, storage. (df-h, ip addr, ps)
Basically it uses the operating system.

docker stats - will show about containers.

what can be run inside containers - Services
stateless/stateful
stateful - whenever you are using the local storage it is stateful
stateless - whenever you are not using local storages it is stateless. Docker works wondrful in stateless application.

image optimisation -
to cut down the sizes and the memory requirement.

docker ps - will give you the docker process running in your system.

docker ps -a will give you all the containers in your machine.

Namespaces - 
there are famous namespaces which helps in creating the isolations.
PID every process is given a unique process id
USR
NET
MOUNT

for your system docker is like a process
But when you go inside your docker, it will again looks like a host process.

Whenever you are installing docker a group gets created (like in windows we have a group for admins) which is called docker. And the members of the docker group will be able to speak to docker engine.

docker client will be accessable to all.

once you have install docker add your user to docker group which is done by below command
sudo usermod -aG docker <name>

-d id docker demon, which will continiously run in the background.

-p (port forwarding)
docker container run -p 8080:8080 ngnix which is similar to 
docker container run -p host port: container port ngnix (container port will be fixed, we can change the host port)
-P (capital P)
docker container run -P ngnix (this will map to the port which is empty automatically without we assign to them)
to add the name of the container use the command --name
example
docker container run -p 8080:8080 --name 'myngnix' ngnix

remove container rm 

docker is a process to the system.

to go inside the container we can use the below cammand

docker exec -it <container id> /bin/bash
ctrl+pq to come out of the container

voloume is a persistance docker image
to add voloume to a container we use docker run container -v /logs:/usr/local/tomcat/logs -P -d tomcat:8

in CMD what ever we write will execute when the container is starting the container is alive when CMD is leaving


Buid the image from Docker file
make a directory images -- mkdir images
go to images -- cd images
in that images create a directory called as hello-alpine
go to hello-alpine  -- cd hello-alpine
in this create a file cvalled as Dockerfile -- vi Dockerfile

:wq- to save the docker image

Now we have a docker file in the directory

Now we need to convert the dockerfile to a image- this is called building the iumage for this we use -- docker build
-t is used for tags to give some name to your image, tags is the versions of the images
-f is used to navigate tonthe path (Over here we need the path where my Docker image is saved)

:wq is used to save the file.
ctrl+o - used to go bottom of the file



 Command to execute the dockwer file -- ubuntu@ip-172-31-19-41:~/images/first-image$ docker image build -t 'first-image' .


Command to remove all the docker container -- container rm -f $(docker container ls -a -q)

Docker and kubernetees


microservices - self excutable part of our application
 
#nanoservices

building a individual smaller application


Docker is used to host all the microservices.
Advantage - portability

capex- capital investiment to host the server
cost of OS
opex- cost for ac, admin etc


VM Ware used to reuse hardware.
docker playround





---
services id demon in linux


docker hub- registry

docker run -d -p 8080:8080 tomcat

tomcat id image

converting a image into a container

downloading the image to the local machine is called as pull


INSTALL DOCKER SWARM

1. install docker-machine first


3. install VBoxManage

sudo apt-add-repository "deb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian $(lsb_release -sc) contrib"
wget -q https://www.virtualbox.org/download/oracle_vbox.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install virtualbox-5.0 dkms 

After this run this command

sudo apt-get install virtaulbox


2. Create a docker machine (to act as a node for docker swarm) create one machine for the manager and other for the container. [Pre-requisite is step 3]

then run this command
docker-machine create -d virtualbox master (master id the name of the manager)

***you might get the below error.

"This computer doesn't have VT-X/AMD-v enabled. Enabling it in the BIOS is mandatory"

Use the below command
docker-machine create master --virtualbox-no-vtx-check

How will you share the voloums between the hostmachine and the containers
docker run -it --name <any name you want to give for voloume> -v /opt/mvn:/opt/centos (path of hostmachine:path of containers)

How you will share voloums between two containers
docker run -it --voloume from <containerID from where you want to share or copy> 

docker stat - will give you the details of the container and the memory utilisation of the container

if you want to restrict the voloume memory you can do that by the following command
docker run -itd  -m 300 M <containerID>

to enter inside the container without running it again use
docker attach <container ID>

to see what are all the commands executed in a container or to see the activity of the conatiner or to see what are all the logs presrnt for a container user
docker log <containerID>

conmmand to extract a tar file -
tar -xvf  <filename.tar.gz>

suppose you want to run the container specific to one network bridge, how will you do that?
docker container run -it <containerID> --net <network name>

important command for docker networking

docker network ls
docker network create --subnet 10.1.1.0/16 --gateway 10.1.1.2 --ip-range=10.1.5.0/24 --driver=bridge --label= <labelName>
docker network ls
docker run -it --<network name> <container name>
docker run -it --<network name> --ip 10.1.0.55 <container name> (if you want to run your container in specific IP)
